# LinuxArchive

## About
in this repo, you can find different types of files that I update over time. These are things that I encounter during my studies, work or free time when I am working with Linux systems. These files include:  
* Scripts
* Command cheat sheet(s)
* Config files
* etc.

Please note that this repo is brand new and that it is under construction. I try to make commits as often as possible, but can't promise the frequency, sorry!

Feel free to use some of my commands, files, etc. Feedback and tips are always welcome!
